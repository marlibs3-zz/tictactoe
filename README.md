TODO:

- Implement undo function (MVP: undo last action, no redo; Extension: undo up to all actions, redo up to all actions, allow a playthrough when the game has been won???)
- Allow "It's a tie!" message if by the 9th move there is no winner without overwriting a winner on the 9th move
- Testing with https://jestjs.io/
